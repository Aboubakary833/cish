## CISH

<p><strong>Cish</strong> is a shell project I'm challenging myself to do in my journey of learning the Golang programming language.</p>

### How to get this project running

<p>As I'm still working on it, I haven't made the binary file available yet, but you can clone the repository, build the code, and execute it.</p>
<p><i>Note:</i> Make sure you have Go (Golang) installed.</p>

<p>To execute the project:</p>

- Build the source code
```sh
make build
```
This command will build the source code and put it in a `bin` folder

- Now you can execute it

```sh
./bin/cish
```

- Or you can simply type

```sh
make run
```
This will build the source code and run it for you.

### Running test

```sh
make test
```
